quick start:

1) you need python 3.6 (or more) with pip and jupyter installed

2) the 'main.ipynb' jupyter notebook contains the actual implementation.
Run it by:
  - opening terminal
  - (optional) creating/opening a virtual env*
  - (first time only) run:
      $ pip install gpkit prettytable numpy
  -  run:
      $ jupyter notebook
  - open the 'main.ipynb' file and run the entire file.


the equations used are all listed, and as much as possible ive tried to cite them/note that they were arbitrary.
